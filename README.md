# Big Data in UK Higher Education

This project explores the impact of Big Data on higher education in the UK. It uses simulated survey data to demonstrate advanced data analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## 🔍 Research Context
Big Data technologies are transforming teaching quality, institutional efficiency, and student experiences in UK universities. This project simulates a study of how students perceive Big Data's influence on education quality.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/`: Survey dataset (CSV)
- `analysis/`: Python notebook and SQL queries
- `dashboard/`: Power BI visuals (to be added)
- `reports/`: Executive summary
- `literature_review/`: Notes and references

## 📊 Methods
- **Python (Google Colab)**: Statistical analysis, correlation heatmaps, group comparisons
- **SQL (SQLite)**: Aggregations, CTEs, CASE statements, window functions
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard (in progress)

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard
